This repository contains files used to construct the final (Nov 2019) versions of the paper.  Note that the folder Table 2 contains data from the older version (from Jan 2019) of the paper.  The updated version of this table has been placed in directory called Table 3.

Scripts are located in the figure folders, the Utilties folder, and the Supplementary Files folder.

In order to reproduce our results, you will need to install EvoNetHIV and edit the scripts in the utility folder.  This will include editing the file location data at the top of these scripts so that they read from and write to the correct parameter / data files. Most of our runs were done on a multi-core simulation cluster.  Getting them to work on other systems could be an involved process.  We would be happy to offer advice to anyone seeking to run these programs.
