This repository contains files used to construct both the old (Jan 2019) and new (Aug 2019) versions of the paper.  Note that the folder Table 2 contains data from the older version (Jan 2019) of the paper.  The updated version of this table has been placed in directory called Table 3.

Figures 1 and S4 are derived from the simulation experiment shown in Figure 2.  Fig S2 is derived from the high risk group experiments described in Table 3.  Supplement 1 is text.

In order to reproduce our results, you will need to install EvoNetHIV and edit the scripts in the utility folder.  This will include editing the file location data at the top of these scripts so that they read from and write to the correct parameter / data files. This will be a fairly involved process. Anyone wishing to do this would be urged to contact us for advice.
